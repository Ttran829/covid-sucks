# covid-sucks
A semester long project for a database systems class, I worked with my partners Shannon Chu and Dong Lee to create a covid-19 check-in system. The website shows data of the number of COVID-19 cases around the United States and updates the data as the user registers their COVID-19 status. The project was mainly focused on the backend side where we used PHP for majority of our tasks.
